GXL Index Search Issue

# Introduction

We found an issue with a GXL built index, and not sure what exactly the problem is.

Basically, we built a GXL index with the GXL2 utilities.  It appears to build successfully, but when we use HNSWLib on the index, it fails with an error we've never seen before.

Below are instructions to reproduce and also what we see when we run it on "apu11" in the SV datacenter.

The script also runs on a GXL index we built several weeks ago, and it seems to work correctly.

Hopefully its something obvious.  Thanks for you help.

# How To Reproduce

Usage: `python3 gxl_debugging.py --dataset <DATASET_PATH_HERE> --gxl <GXL_BIN_PATH_HERE>`

Example: `python3 gxl_debugging.py --dataset ../datasets/deep-image-96-angular/deep-image-96-angular.hdf5 --gxl /home/public/GXL_2.0/bin`

# Example Output

```
$ conda create gxl-debugging python=3.10

$ conda activate gxl-debugging

$ python -m pip install -r ../requirements

$ python3 gxl_debugging.py --dataset ../datasets/deep-image-96-angular/deep-image-96-angular.hdf5 --gxl /home/public/GXL_2.0/bin
